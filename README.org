#+TITLE: Maze Solver

This program randomly generates a maze using tkinter and then uses depth-first
search to solve the maze.

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To run the program you will just need to run the following:
#+begin_src shell
  ./main.sh
#+end_src

This will open a new window where the maze will be draw out and then solved.
